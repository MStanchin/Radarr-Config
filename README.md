# Radarr-Config

This is a Radarr backup for a clean install with Profiles from Trash-Guides. All indexers, downloaders, personal settings have been wiped. You will need to configure everything as if you were installing a new instance. Make sure to refresh/recreate the API token for Radarr in Settings > General > Security as this backup uses a saved default. Download the backup but do not unzip the "radarr backup-profiles only.zip" file. Radarr needs to read the file as a .zip when restoring.
